        You have being assigned to the role of <strong>Player B</strong> and you are part of a group of 3
        participants (including yourself). The 3 members of your group are all <strong>Players B</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <input id="info_button1" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button1, paragraph1);" />

        <div id="paragraph1" class="hidden-paragraph">
    <p> All members of your group participated in Part 1 and earned an income from it.</p>

    <p> You are now asked to report the income you earned in Part 1 starting from the {{ Constants.payoff_trial }}
        you earned in the practice round, to calculate your final
        earnings. <strong>The income that you report will be taxed at the rate of {{Constants.tax_rate}}%</strong>.

    <input id="info_button2" type="button" value="&#xf178" onclick="button_click(info_button2, paragraph2);" />

        <div id="paragraph2" class="hidden-paragraph">

    <p> The other Players B in your group are also asked to report their incomes for taxation. Your income
    report, as well as the income report of the other players in your group, is completely private.
        <strong>You won't know their income report, and they won't know yours</strong>.

     <p>

    <p>
         Taxes collected will be <strong>doubled</strong> and given to the organisation
         <strong>Keep Britain Tidy</strong> at the end of this study.
         The money will be used to support its actions of reducing litter, improving local places,
         and preventing waste in the UK.

    <p> Your group is going to be randomly matched with <strong>1 Player A out of 10 Players A</strong>. In a previous study,
        the 10 Players A already decided whether to take {{Constants.money_to_take}} from the collected taxes of the
    group of Players B they are going to be matched with.
        </p>

    <p> They could take the {{Constants.money_to_take}} from the collected taxes before being doubled
        and transferred to Keep Britain Tidy. These {{Constants.money_to_take}} points correspond to the
        collected taxes coming from the group of Players B's earnings in the practice round in Part 1.

         One participant out the 10 presented in the picture will be randomly selected and matched with your group.
